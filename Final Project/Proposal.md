My final project is mostly going to be a bunch of objects in the canvas of various shapes/sizes/colors.
I will use what we have learned/will learn and incorporate some stuff I have found online.
A stretch goal will be adding more different objects I have found on the internet or decided to make myself.

Week 1: Information gathering how different applications and different ways of coding for desired results
Week 2: Draw the minimal objects needed into the scene with textures/colors
Week 3: Adding the motion required of project
Week 4: Debugging if any occurs, add lighting effects
Week 5(Strecth Goal): New objects and Debugging if needed

Implementation:
  THREE.js
