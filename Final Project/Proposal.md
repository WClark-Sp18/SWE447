My final project is going to be a basic platformer level.
I will use what we have learned/will learn and incorporate some stuff I have found online.
A stretch goal will be adding more enemies and power-ups like in Mario.

Week 1: Information gathering how different applications and different ways of coding for desired results
Week 2: Draw the minimal objects needed into the scene with textures/colors
Week 3: Adding the motion required of project
Week 4: Debugging if any occurs, add lighting effects
Week 5(Strecth Goal): New objects and Debugging if needed
