<h2>Proposal</h2>
<p>
My final project is going to be a basic platformer level.

I will use what we have learned/will learn and incorporate some stuff I have found online.

A stretch goal will be adding more enemies and power-ups like in Mario.

</p>
<ul>
  </i>Week 1: Information gathering how different applications and different ways of coding for desired results</li>
  <li>Week 2: Draw the minimal objects needed into the scene with textures/colors</li>
  <li>Week 3: Adding the motion required of project</li>
  <li>Week 4: Debugging if any occurs, add lighting effects</li>
  <li>Week 5(Strecth Goal): New objects and Debugging if needed</li>
</ul>

<p>Implementation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>node.js</li>
  <li>Phaser Game Engine</li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic Platformer</h2>
<p>i used node.js to create a local webserver and then set it up for phaser</p>
<p>used the assets created by phaser for sprites</p>
<p>made the script for displaying all the sprites and placing them on the "canvas"</p>
